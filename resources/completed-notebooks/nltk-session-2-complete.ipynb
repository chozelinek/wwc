    "# Session 2: Common NLTK tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we provide an quick introduction to the field of *corpus linguistics*. We then engage with common uses of NLTK within these areas, such as sentence segmentation, tokenisation and stemming. Often, NLTK has inbuilt methods for performing these tasks. As a learning exercise, however, we will sometimes build basic tools from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Corpus linguistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Though corpus linguistics has been around since the 1950s, it is only in the last 20 years that its methods have been made available to individual researchers. GUIs including [Wordsmith Tools](http://www.lexically.net/wordsmith/) and [AntConc](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside the development of GUIs, there has also been a shift from *general, balanced corpora* (corpora seeking to represent a language generally) toward *specialised corpora* (corpora containing texts of one specific type, from one speaker, etc.). More and more commonly, texts are taken from the Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll discuss building corpora from online texts in a bit more detail later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a long period of resistance, corpus linguistics has gained acceptence within a number of research areas. A few popular applications are within:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lexicography** (creating usage-based definitions of words and locating real examples)\n",
    "* **Language pedagogy** (advanced language learners can use a concordancing GUI or collocation tests to understand how certain words are used in the target language)\n",
    "* **Discourse analysis** (researching how meaning is made beyond the level of the clause/sentence)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, corpus linguistic methods have been embraced within the emerging paradigm of Digital Humanities, where it's sometimes called *distant reading*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corpora and discourse\n",
    "\n",
    "As hardware, software and data become more and more available, people have started using corpus linguistic methods for discourse-analytic work. Paul Baker refers the combination of corpus linguistics and (critical) discourse analysis as a [*useful methodological synergy*](#ref:baker). Corpora bring objectivity and empiricism to a qualitative, interpretative tradition, while discourse- analytic methods provide corpus linguistics with a means of contextualising abstracted results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this area, researchers rely on corpora to varying extents. In *corpus-driven* discourse analysis, researchers interpret the corpus based on the findings of the corpus interrogation. In *corpus-assisted* discourse analysis, researchers may use corpora to provide evidence about the way a given person/idea/discourse is commonly represented by certain people/in certain publications etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our work here falls under the *corpus-driven* heading, as we are exploring the dataset without any major hypotheses in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Some linguists remain skeptical of corpus linguistics generally. In\n",
    "a well-known critique, Henry Widdowson ([2000, p. 6-7](#ref:widdowson)) said:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Corpus linguistics \\[...\\] (there) is no doubt that this is an immensely important development in descriptive linguistics. That is not the issue here. The quantitative analysis of text by computer reveals facts about actual language behaviour which are not, or at least not immediately, accessible to intuition. There are frequencies of occurrence of words, and regular patterns of collocational co-occurrence, which users are unaware of, though they must be part of their competence in a procedural sense since they would not otherwise be attested. They are third person observed data ('When do they use the word X?') which are different from the first person data of introspection ('When do I use the word X?'), and the second person data of elicitation ('When do you use the word X?'). Corpus analysis reveals textual facts, fascinating profiles of produced language, and its concordances are always springing surprises. They do indeed reveal a reality about language usage which was hitherto not evident to its users.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> But this achievement of corpus analysis at the same time necessarily defines its limitations. For one thing, since what is revealed is contrary to intuition, then it cannot represent the reality of first person awareness. We get third person facts of what people do, but not the facts of what people know, nor what they think they do: they come from the perspective of the observer looking on, not the introspective of the insider. In ethnomethodogical terms, we do not get member categories of description. Furthermore, it can only be one aspect of what they do that is captured by such quantitative analysis. For, obviously enough, the computer can only cope with the material products ofwhat people do when they use language. It can only analyse the textual traces of the processes whereby meaning is achieved: it cannot account for the complex interplay of linguistic and contextual factors whereby discourse is enacted. It cannot produce ethnographic descriptions of language use. In reference to Hymes's components of communicative competence (Hymes 1972), we can say that corpus analysis deals with the textually attested, but not with the encoded possible, nor the contextually appropriate.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To point out these rather obvious limitations is not to undervalue corpus analysis but to define more clearly where its value lies. What it can do is reveal the properties of text, and that is impressive enough. But it is necessarily only a partial account of real language. For there are certain aspects of linguistic reality that it cannot reveal at all. In this respect, the linguistics of the attested is just as partial as the linguistics of the possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading a corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have to load a corpus. We'll use a text file containing posts to [an Australian online forum](http://www.ozpolitic.com/forum/YaBB.pl?board=global) for discussing politics. It's full of very interesting natural language data!\n",
    "\n",
    "This file is available online, at the Research Platforms [GitHub](https://github.com/resbaz/nltk). We can ask Python to get it for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Later in the course, we'll discuss how to extract data from the Web and turn this data into a corpus."
